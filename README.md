This add-in for COMSOL Multiphysics provides a user interface to calculate Mean Squared Displacement values for simulations done in the Particle Tracing Module.

It can calculate MSD for 2D or 3D physics and also provides calculation of autocorrelation functions for any variable by a single click of a button.

This add-in was developed as part of a Master's thesis titled 'Computer Modeling of Diffusional Transport in Hydrogel' at the Faculty of Chemistry, Brno University of Technology. The full thesis can be accessed at https://www.vut.cz/en/students/final-thesis/detail/156714.
